      <br />
      <div>
        Please read the following terms and conditions carefully. You must not
        make any booking unless you are 18 years of age or older and understand
        and agree with the following terms and conditions.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        These terms and conditions apply to bookings you make with a Consultant
        (instore, over the phone or by email) as well as online bookings made
        via our website. These terms and conditions govern our relationship with
        you. Once we accept a booking from you on behalf of a Supplier, you will
        also have a separate contract with the Supplier, which will be governed
        by other terms and conditions. It is your responsibility to make
        yourself aware of those other terms and conditions.

      <h4>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4>

      <div>
        <div>
          Although you should read all of the terms and conditions, the
          following is a summary of the most important:
        </div>

        <li>
          Prices, including, in some cases, of confirmed bookings, may be
          subject to change.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some confirmed bookings are non-refundable if cancelled by you and it
          is your responsibility to check if this applies.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will be entitled to retain our service fees even if a booking is
          cancelled or does not proceed for any reason which is not our fault.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of all information
          relevant to your travel plans, including but not limited to visa
          requirements and health precautions.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are not your agent and may receive additional fees or other
          incentives from Suppliers.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are not liable for the accuracy of any published Supplier content
          including websites and brochures.
        </li>
      </div>
      <br />
      <h5>PRICES AND TAXES</h5>

      <div>
        All prices that we quote are in Australian Dollars and based on twin
        share accommodation unless otherwise stated. Please note that prices
        quoted are subject to change at the discretion of the Supplier prior to
        booking. Price changes may occur after booking because of matters
        outside our control which increase the cost of the Product. Such factors
        include adverse currency fluctuations, fuel surcharges, taxes and
        airfare increases. Please contact your Consultant for up-to-date prices.
        Even if paid in full, a price may change because of matters outside our
        control.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        Prices include all applicable taxes requiring payment prior to
        departure, and may be subject to adjustment in the event of an increase
        in those taxes. On other occasions, you may be liable for taxes in
        addition to the quoted price of the Product. For example, there may be a
        local tax charged at some airports or resorts.
